truth if you're reading this
hi
we need to come up with a new protocol, still using 2048 bit RSA and with basically the same procedures
but with symetric encryption, hashing and RSA for signing NOT encryption
the database would be largely the same but the message sending process will be slightly different
read through the current code and see what you think
if you do end up making a new version of send_message, use nc -l 3623 to test without writing server code


if you could write a wrappr for the sqlite3 libary that automatically calls commit() after each execute call and
returns dictionary when db.execute is called so i dont have to call fucking fetchall every time ill gargle your piss
good night, and godspeed
